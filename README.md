# Fraud-Detection-Credit-Card-Transaction
A typical way of detect fraud in credit card transactions; See README.md for more details;


### Before we start

I took the course taught by Prof. Stephen Coggeshall (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-coggeshall-14908a2/). He is one of the smartest individual in the field of consumer risk. In my GitHub repositories, I have three projects on fraud detection. 

I find that though I love python but it is not represented on my reporistories. I spent a whole year at Disney and worked on data science projects through python. However, all though I am the writer, those codes do not belong to me.  

The project was initially conducted in R. But I now I decided to re-do it in python. However, this time I will just go through the basic steps and will not focus too much on details. It should be something like a typical tutorial on the Internet. 


### The Business Problem

Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such as a credit card or a debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services without paying, or to obtain unauthorized amount of funds.

Credit card fraud happens when consumers give their credit card number to unfamiliar individuals, when cards are lost or stolen, when mail is diverted from the intended recipient and taken by criminals, or when employees of a business copy the cards for personal uses. Typically, when a credit card transactions are made frequently within a specific period or with a large amount, there is high potentiality of credit card fraud.

This report commits to examine the 95007 credit card transactions, and detect abnormality and potential fraud.

The dataset is pretty small.
